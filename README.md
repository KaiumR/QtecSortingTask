Based on the system requirements, multiple solutions could be possible for this problem. I will discuss two possible solutions.

Solution 1:
If the system prioritizes space, then this solution is more efficient than the other one. I have used the insertion sort algorithm to sort the array and then the binary search algorithm to find the target value. The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2)\) as the insertion sort takes \(O(n^2)\) time to sort the array, while the binary search algorithm takes \(O(\log n)\) time to find the target value. I could have used a simple traversal method to find the value instead of binary search, which would have taken \(O(n)\) time. In that case, the overall time complexity would not be affected as the time complexity of the solution is already \(O(n^2)\). In terms of space complexity, insertion sort requires \(O(1)\) complexity.

Solution 2:
If the system prioritizes time, then this solution is more efficient than the previous one. Merge sort algorithm has been used to sort the array, and binary search algorithm to find the target value. The time complexity of merge sort is \(O(n \log n)\) and space complexity is \(O(n)\). Binary search takes \(O(\log n)\) hence it doesn't make any impact on the overall time complexity.

Comparative discussion:
If the system prioritizes space, then the first solution is more efficient due to its \(O(1)\) space complexity, compared to the \(O(n)\) space complexity of the second solution.
Conversely, if the system prioritizes time over space, the second solution is more effective since it has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), whereas the first solution has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\).
